# CLI Task Examples

This repository contains sample challenges and expert solution traces, demonstrating the creation of structured problem-solving tasks for AI training and evaluation—similar to the work done by companies like Parsewave.

## Purpose
To showcase the ability to:
- **Design** a self-contained, verifiable CLI challenge.
- **Author** a clear, step-by-step expert trace that explains the rationale, commands, and alternatives.

## Sample Challenge
- **[The Log File Detective](challenge_directory_puzzle.md)**: A task focused on archive extraction, text processing, and data filtering using a sequence of command-line tools.

## Sample Expert Trace
- **[Expert Solution Trace](expert_solution_trace.md)**: A detailed walkthrough of the solution, explaining the command chain, efficiency considerations, and key concepts.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Technical Task Design
- Bash/Shell Scripting Concepts
- Complex Problem Decomposition
- Clear Technical Documentation
- Anticipation of Edge Cases & Alternatives
